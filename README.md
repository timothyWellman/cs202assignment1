outline of steps
  design functions:

      run getting functions

      provide output text
    getWords
      open other file
      until the file is completed, store each word as a string in array
      when file done, close file
    findLongestWord
      run through each word string
        count the characters in the string & compare with a dummy variable. if dummy variable is too small, set it to new word length & store array index in second dummy variable
      return the word indexed as the 
    countCharacters
    countUppercaseLetters
    countLettersInRange
  map project flow
    set up process of function calling
    refactor to spec
